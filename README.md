This repo is largely based on a [working repo](https://github.com/joehjhuang/gs_sdk) from CMU's [Joe Huang](https://joehjhuang.github.io/).

This repo has made many significant and (imo) better adjustment to the official GelSight driver code, and we recommand that you use this instead of the official driver especially if you want to work with ROS2
